    "## Generate CSV File with Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to create a CSV file that holds the scores for each of the signals found in the test data set. Each line of your CSV file \"Scorecard\", will contain the signal's UUID, followed by scores for each signal class. (The signal class with the highest score would be your model's class estimation. Typically these's scores are the probability estimates for each class.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The test data files are nearly the same as the training sets. The only difference is the JSON header in each file does not contain the signal class. You can use `ibmseti` python package to read each file, just like you would the training data. See [Step_2_reading_SETI_code_challenge_data.ipynb](tutorials/Step_2_reading_SETI_code_challenge_data.ipynb) for examples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For each data file in the test set, generate the appropriate spectrogram, and then pass that to your signal classifier to calculate the scores for each class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, each line in the CSV file should look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `abdefg-adbc12-23234-123123-cvaf, 0.1, 0.023, 0.451, 0.232, 0.001, 0.07, 0.0083`\n",
