### Creating your first project notebook

1. Direct your browser to https://datascience.ibm.com/ and log in using the email address you've provided in your team sign-up sheet.

2. Select **Projects** > **View All Projects**

   ![Open project list](../img/dsx/open_project_list.png)

3. Click on the project named after our team. _Contact the event staff if you cannot see the project._ 

   ![Open project](../img/dsx/open_project_list.png)

4. This project is empty by default. Create a new notebook by clicking **add notebooks**.

   ![Add notebook](../img/dsx/new_notebook.png)

5. Select **Blank**, type in a notebook name and make sure **Python 2**, **Spark 2.0** and **Spark-SETI-Enterprise** are selected. Click **Create Notebook**.
  
> You may also select "From URL" and then paste in the GitHub "Raw" URL of an example Notebook in this repository

6. The notebook opens and a Spark kernel is automatically started.

   ![Add notebook](../img/dsx/open_notebook.png)

   > Because event resources are limited you may only utilize one Enterprise Spark kernel during the event. You can create as many notebooks in Data Science Experience as you wish but must never run more than one notebook at a time. Each notebook is associated with a kernel and will remain running until you explicitly shut down the kernel. 
   
### Saving the notebook

Notebooks are perioodically saved. However, to avoid losing any changes manually save changes by selecting **File** > **Save**.

### Checking the Spark kernel status

You can view the Spark kernel status in the project overview.

   ![Check kernel status](../img/dsx/check_kernel_status.png)

### Stopping the Spark kernel

* You can stop a running kernel in the project overview by selecting **â€¦** > **Stop Kernel**.

   ![Stop kernel](../img/dsx/stop_kernel.png)

* To stop a kernel while the notebook is open select **File** > **Stop Kernel**.

   ![Stop kernel in notebook](../img/dsx/stop_kernel_in_notebook.png)

### Restarting the Spark kernel

To restart a kernel while the notebook is open select **Kernel** > **Restart**.

   ![Restart kernel](../img/dsx/restart_kernel_in_notebook.png)

### Re-opening a notebook

To re-open a notebook open the project overview and click the pencil icon.
