# Getting Started

### Sign Up for IBM Data Science Experience

The fastest way to get started, and the best experience, will be if you work from within 
IBM Data Science Experience (DSX). Go to https://datascience.ibm.com to sign up for an account. When you sign
up, an IBM Bluemix account will also be created for you (with the same credentials).

### Tutorials

From IBM DSX, you can begin to access the data by running the introductory notebooks. One thing to note: use Python 2.7 instead of Python 3.5. The `ibmseti` package only installs on 2.x at the moment.
